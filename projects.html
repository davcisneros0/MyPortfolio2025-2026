                <p class="homepage-work-content-section-details">One of my assignments in my web authoring course was to recreate a website as if I 
                    had been hired by a real company. For this project, I aimed to design something sleek, minimalistic, and visually engaging, with an 
                    emphasis on natural colors and imagery.
                <br><br>
                I chose the National Park Foundation as my subject because I was inspired by my recent visits to several national parks in Florida with friends, 
                and I wanted to capture that same sense of beauty and exploration in my design.

                <p class="homepage-work-content-section-details">After becoming comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I wanted to expand my skills by 
                    exploring back-end development. This included working with databases, learning about normalization, and using PHP to query and manage data.
                <br><br>
              The goal of this project was to allow users to add a cat to the Purrfect database through a form using SQLite, or to browse a collection of adoptable cats retrieved dynamically through PHP.

                <p class="homepage-work-content-section-details">I really wanted to learn more about APIs and how they worked through Javascript such as fetch and handling responses.
                <br><br>
                While using various APIs such as ipify to retrieve a user's IP address and Geoapify, I designed a small dashboard that displayed a user's IP address and their geolocation.
